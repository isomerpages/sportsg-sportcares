#### SportCares utilises the power of community based sporting experiences to harness the life aspirations of vulnerable children, youth-at-risk, needy seniors and persons with disabilities.

By using sport as an engagement strategy to bring about positive change in their lives, we are able to address social issues in the community. 

In addition to designing and delivering sport-centric programmes for our beneficiaries, we also advise organisations on benefits of harnessing the power of sport as a means of social change.

At present, we have impacted the lives of more than 22,000 constituents across Singapore.

Working alongside like-minded partners from government agencies, corporates and non-profit organisations allow us to take a community development approach to bring about long-term change in the lives of our beneficiaries.
