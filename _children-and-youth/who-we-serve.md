Singaporean youth come up tops when it comes to enjoying a high quality of life while being able to tap on some of the best opportunities the country has to offer.

But there remains a small group of youth who, because of their circumstances or family backgrounds, are not able to make the most of the opportunities at hand.

Referred to as “Youth At-Risk” (or "at risk youth"), they are identified based on recurring behavioural pattern.  In Singapore, these youth may have: 

> * Conduct issues;
> * Peer or family relationship issues;
> * Bullying (bully or victim);
> * Social difficulties;
> * Anti-social attitudes or behaviours;
> * Dependence/addiction to cyber activities, drinking, sexual activities, substances etc;
> * Incarceration of parents or significant care-giver;
> * Criminal conduct; and/or 
> * Poor response to school intervention;
