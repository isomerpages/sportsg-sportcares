#### President Encourages Persons With Disabilities To Play Sport Regularly At The Inaugural Inclusive Sport Conference 2021

Singapore, 16 March 2021 – Sport Singapore (SportSG) will introduce a new Social Service Corporate Membership scheme, which will be rolled out from June this year. The scheme aims to encourage organised, regular sports and exercise sessions for persons with disabilities (PwDs) at ActiveSG sport centres. This will include curated programming with partner organisations, as well as free access for their beneficiaries to ActiveSG swimming pools and gyms. The new scheme was announced by SportCares Patron and Guest-of-Honour President Halimah Yacob at the inaugural Inclusive Sport Conference 2021.

“Sport has long been recognised as a good way to bring people together, regardless of who we are and where we come from. It is thus an excellent driving force to empower persons with disabilities to improve their quality of life, build independence and stay healthy physically and mentally,” said Madam President. “Through the Social

Service Corporate Membership scheme, SportSG will work with partner organisations to encourage persons with disabilities to kickstart an active lifestyle through regular sport and exercise activities at our ActiveSG Centres.”

Targeting more than 13,000 new members, the scheme hopes to get more PwDs to participate in sporting activities more than once a week. For a start, Social Service Agencies will be given $1,000 ActiveSG credits to book facilities and programmes offered by ActiveSG The 2019 National Sports Participation Survey revealed that 1 in 2 persons with disabilities participated in at least one sport activity every week, which is a significant increase from the 2016 survey that showed only 1 in 3 persons participated in sports.

“The Social Service Corporate Membership scheme aims to encourage persons with different abilities to participate in sport and sustain an active lifestyle. It will create opportunities for the community to enjoy sport together at our ActiveSG centres, building better understanding and fostering meaningful friendships across people of all abilities. It is through progressive steps like this that we can build toward making Singapore a more inclusive sporting nation,” said Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth & Second Minister for Law.

I am confident that the ideas and discussions put forth at today’s conference can catalyse partnerships among the many stakeholders in Singapore’s disability community, to empower Persons with Disabilities through sport and build a more inclusive society.”

The three-day virtual conference will discuss topics ranging from the individual level to community and ecosystem levels, targeting specific focus areas and knowledge gaps surrounding inclusion and adapted sports.
