#### A weekend of inclusive sports activities at the soft-launch of sports facilities at Our Tampines Hub

**Singapore, 29 July 2017** – This weekend, the community can get a chance to participate in over 10 sports try-outs at the Inclusive Sports Festival (ISF) at Our Tampines Hub. With the aim to reach create the awareness on the types of para-sports available, participants had the chance to have fun and play sports like Curling, Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) Ninja Warrior, Sailing, Goalball and even traditional games like Zero Point.

Minister for Culture, Community & Youth, Ms Grace Fu said, “Sport has the ability to build up resilience and confidence in people. Communities are beginning to embrace sport, because the benefits go beyond physical wellness. Parents are also taking their children to try out sports because it enables them to be more sociable and emotionally strong. This is why I’m very happy that we have the inaugural Inclusive Sports Festival at Our Tampines Hub. Through this Festival, we see people of all ages and abilities playing inclusive sports; it’s also a way of bringing communities and families together.”

The Inclusive Sports Festival will take place at Our Tampines Hub on Saturday & Sunday, 29 – 30 July at Our Tampines Hub from 10am to 7pm.
