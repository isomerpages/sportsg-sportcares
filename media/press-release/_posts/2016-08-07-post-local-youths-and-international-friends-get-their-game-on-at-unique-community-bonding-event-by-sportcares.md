**Singapore, 7 August 2016** – Some 500 participants had a morning of fun and games at Game ON today ̶ an inaugural event to promote social integration and bonding between Singaporeans and international friends. 
An acronym for “Get Active, Meet Everyone, One Nation”, Game ON was organised by Tuas View Dormitory in partnership with SportCares Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Sport Singapore that taps on sports as an enabler for social good. Game ON is also of GetActive! Singapore, a week-long sporting bash that is designed to have Singaporeans all celebrating National Day together.

“We live in a vibrant society made up of different races, ethnicities and religion. It is only natural to bring the community together, including our international friends, as one Singapore, to celebrate the nation’s birthday. Game ON is a wonderful example of the events that have been taking place week-long under the GetActive! Singapore banner. Sport gives us a way to build multi-cultural friendships and forge shared memories through sports,” said Toh Boon Yi, Chief of the Strategic Development and Marketing Group, Sport Singapore.

“It is heartening to witness the spectacular display of smiles, laughter and friendships created at this event. As One Team Singapore, I believe our young Singaporeans who joined us today, took away something new about the different cultures and traditions, likewise for our international friends.”

####Celebrating Friendships through Sports

Held at Tuas View Dormitory, participants were teamed up in groups of four, comprising of tertiary students and youths from SportCares and migrant workers from across Asia. Team Nila volunteers from community partners and schools supported Game ON by facilitating the activities at the event.

Game ON carried an Amazing Race-styled format, with games and activities bearing three core themes of Sport Skills, Culture & Heritage, and National Day. The themes were designed to spur participant interactions, sharing of their knowledge and expertise, and team work, in order to complete up to 29 group-based games, trivia and challenges. Teams were also given a maximum of two hours to complete as many stations as possible. 

Mr R. Subra, Director of Operations at TS Group said, “This is a unique platform for our residents here at Tuas View Dormitory to enjoy fun and games, while bonding with young Singaporeans. The community activities at Game ON were well-thought through to include different cultures, promoting international understanding and respect for diversity. We look forward to working with SportCares in the future to organize more such community events here with our residents.”

The stations included popular local childhood games like Chopsticks, Capteh, and trivias on national logos and monuments, as well as activities such as synchronised jumping jacks, group skipping and obstacle courses. 

A mini Game ON carnival was also set up within Tuas View Dormitory, where participants could savour Singapore cuisines and capture fun moments together with their new friends at a photo booth.

“It was great fun participating in Game ON! It was a unique event for us to make friends with people from other countries. I found it insightful to learn about their cultures that I never knew before, and likewise, they were excited to find out more about the local traditions too,” said 19 year-old Suhair Bin Kamil, a youth participant from SportCares.
