### AXA Rallies Individuals in Singapore to Show Care through Virtual #AXAHugsForGood Challenge and support SportCares

This year's edition of AXA's 'For Good' Challenge sees itself rallying everyone in Singapore to show care for the people in their lives through a virtual hug.

During these COVID-19 times where individuals continue to be more digitally connected but physically distanced, the virtual hugs sent, together with personalised messages, reflects an individual's care and support for one another. 

From today till 31 December 2020, every one is invited to join the #AXAHugsForGood challenge by creating and sending personalised virtual hugs to family members, friends, colleagues or anyone in their life via [AXAHugsForGood website](https://axahugsforgood.com/)

For every virtual hug sent, AXA will add $5 to a donation pool for its two supported social causes, SportCares and Singapore Cancer Society, up to a total of S$50,000.

> "At SportCares, we strive to inculcate strong social values including care for one another and the community through sport.  Initiatives like the #AXAHugsForGood challenge are critical especially in a time such as this where community support is necessary.  We are encouraged by the continued efforts of AXA to rally individuals in Singapore to play a part for the collective good and are honoured to be part of the challenge." Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Sport Singapore
