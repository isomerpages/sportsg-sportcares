### **Spotlight on Youth Industry Traineeship (YIT): Preparing Youth for Tomorrow**

In our quest to provide holistic development, we have introduced the YIT programme. This short-term education and training initiative aims at equipping SportCares youths aged 18 to 24 with essential skills and work experience, especially if they are treading on a path unfamiliar to them.

Our inaugural batch of 12 enthusiastic individuals gained valuable experience at esteemed institutions, including SportSG's Para Sport Academy, Sport Science Institute, and SportFive, a renowned local sports marketing agency.
