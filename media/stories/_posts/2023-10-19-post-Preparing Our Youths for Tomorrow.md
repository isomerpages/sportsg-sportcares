At SportCares, we firmly believe in the power of education and its impact on transforming lives. And yesterday evening, we got the chance to honour our second batch of SportCares Scholarship/Education Award recipients alongside our pioneer batch of Youth Industry Traineeship (YIT) participants.

These two initiatives underscore our commitment to nurturing young minds and empowering them to dream big, regardless of their background.

### **Understanding the SportCares Scholarship/Education Award**

The SportCares Scholarship/Education Award is a testament to our dedication to fostering educational advancement among our SportCares youths.

This initiative offers financial assistance to those keen on furthering their studies:

*   **SportCares Scholarship:**&nbsp;For youths pursuing courses at a local polytechnic or university.
*   **SportCares Education Award:**&nbsp;For youths pursuing courses at the Institute for Technical Education (ITE).

At the heart of this award scheme lies our&nbsp;_Hearts Framework of Care_. This unique approach encourages these young individuals to "Lead Community" and embody the spirit of giving.
