Early last year, we started exploring avenues that would further strengthen the lives of our participants, specifically for the young adults who were about to take the all-important step into building a career path in areas of their interest.

We spoke to our partners internally at Sport Singapore and externally through our corporate and community partner networks. While acknowledging that our participants may face challenges as they embark on this new journey, we decided to kick off a new initiative, Youth Industry Traineeship (YIT), to help bridge the gap and equip them with the skills and confidence they need to succeed in their soon-to-be careers.

Open to youth between the ages of 17 to 23, the YIT is designed to allow them to join companies and learn valuable life and employable skills. The participants will also be matched with a mentor through the SportCares Mentorship Programme, who will help guide them through every step of the process. They will then be placed in an industry setting that allows them to engage with an employer and access relevant career guidance and support. 

The YIT has gotten off to a good start, with four different companies coming on board to work with our pioneer batch of participants and helping each one of them gain the skills and confidence they need to enter the workforce.

We have also had our youth share with us their increased self-esteem, improved communication skills, and how they are gaining an understanding of their career options.

To our pioneer batch of YIT participants, thank you for letting us journey with you on this exciting phase of your life.

To all our partners, internal and external, we thank you for your valuable insights from the moment we reached out to you and the extensive support you continue to share with us.
