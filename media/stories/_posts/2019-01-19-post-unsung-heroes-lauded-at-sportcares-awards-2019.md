A collective of six individuals and organisations was recognised at the inaugural SportCares Awards on Saturday (19 Jan) for their efforts to change lives through sport.

President Halimah Yacob, together with CEO of Sport Singapore Mr Lim Teck Yin, presented the awards to the six winners in three categories: Coaches Chris Yip, Isa Haleem and Daniel Lee each received the Coaching Inspiration Award; Noor Faizal Bin Rabu and NTU Welfare Services Club received the Sporting Inspiration Award, and Changi Foundation received the Corporate Giving Inspiration Award.

One of the awards winners for the Sporting Inspiration Award is the NTU Welfare Service Club, who has been a SportCares partner since 2015, and helped raised $50,000 for their NTU SEA Lions Programme.

Ms Sarah Quek, a member of the NTU SEA Lions Programme, said: “I joined the programme as I thought it was meaningful yet different from the other volunteering opportunities available. I had the chance to mentor and befriend many of the participants and I am glad they saw me as a role model too. I feel proud when I see participants overcome their fear of the water or when they are able to make better decisions through our help.”

The award ceremony hosted at the Istana was held in conjunction with a picnic organised for the SportCares family, which included family-friendly activities such as giant jenga, ring toss and carrom, for those of all ages and abilities to enjoy.

President Halimah said: “Using athletics, basketball, football, outdoor adventure, rugby, sailing, swimming and tennis as key channels for social development through sport, SportCares today mentors close to 1,000 children and youths. They have, in turn, collectively contributed more than 20,000 hours of volunteerism in the community.

“It is timely for us to acknowledge and recognise the contributions of individuals and organisations who have supported SportCares in their initiatives.”
