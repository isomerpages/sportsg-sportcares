<p>In the heart of Yishun, a community is being introduced to the power of
sport, with two dedicated youth coaches from SportCares' Youth Coaching
Development Pathway (YCDP) initiative playing an important role. As part
of the Fun Starters programme in partnership with Temasek Foundation, these
coaches impart fundamental sports skills and instil values that go beyond
the field of play.</p>
<p>SportCares, the philanthropic arm of Sport Singapore, has long been committed
to leveraging sport as a tool for positive social change. The YCDP is one
such initiative aimed at nurturing youth coaches who, in turn, contribute
to engaging the broader community through sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meet 28-year-old Muhammad Fadhil Bin Ishak and 21-year-old Matin Nufael
Ridzal, two youth coaches who have come through the YCDP initiative and
embraced their roles in Fun Starters with enthusiasm, making a significant
impact on the lives of the participants in Yishun.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fadhil, a former SportCares participant, found his calling in coaching
through SportCares. He said, "Being part of YCDP was transformative. It's
not just about teaching sports skills; it's about building character and
fostering a sense of community. The Fun Starters Programme is where we
lay the foundation for a lifelong love of sports."</p>
<p>Matin, on the other hand, discovered his passion for coaching while interning
with SportCares in 2021. "YCDP provided me with the necessary tools and
mentorship to transition from a volunteer to a certified coach. Now, I'm
inspired to be contributing to the community through sport," he added.</p>
<p>Fun Starters in Yishun focuses on introducing children aged 5 to 12 to
various sports in an engaging and fun environment. Under the guidance of
lead coach Sheik Abdul Rahman, who is assisted by Fadhil and Matin, these
young participants are not just learning to kick a ball or score goals
but picking up essential life skills such as teamwork, perseverance, and
discipline.</p>
<p>One of the key aspects of the programme is its emphasis on inclusivity.
Matin explained, "We want every child to feel included and valued. It's
about creating a space where every child feels confident to participate
and enjoy the process of learning."</p>
<p>The team behind the Fun Starters also works closely with parents, emphasising
the overall development of their children. Regular communication sessions
and workshops are organised to provide parents with insights into the positive
influence of sports on a child's physical, mental, and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>YCDP ensures that coaches like Fadhil and Matin possess the technical
expertise of sports coaching and understand the social dynamics of the
communities they serve. By fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility
among these coaches, SportCares aims to create a sustainable model for
community development through sport.</p>

<p>As Fun Starters gains momentum in Yishun, the influence on the community
becomes clear. Parents share updates with the team of administrators and
coaches on the positive changes they observe in their children. The camaraderie
among the children fosters a community spirit that extends beyond the programme.</p>
<p>The SportCares Youth Coaching Development Pathway is not just producing
skilled coaches; it's cultivating community leaders who are shaping the
future through sport. Fadhil and Matin demonstrate the transformative power
of sports coaching, proving that with the proper guidance, passion, and
commitment, a community can be uplifted, one participant at a time.</p>
<p>And the Fun Starters programme in Yishun is a testament to the continuing
impact of SportCares' vision â€“ changing lives through sport.</p>
