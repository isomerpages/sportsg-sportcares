Instrumental to this effort is the support from over 100 community partners including Singapore Pools. The annual Football With A Heart event, jointly organised by Singapore Pools, Football Association of Singapore and Sport Singapore, is an example of a community of care coming together to make a difference in the lives of SportCares’ beneficiaries – youths from our Saturday Night Lights (SNL) programmes. SNL is our flagship programme that provides a safe and structured environment for youths from vulnerable backgrounds to play football, build character, develop life skills and be part of a community. We are committed to building communities of care and using sport to change lives.”
