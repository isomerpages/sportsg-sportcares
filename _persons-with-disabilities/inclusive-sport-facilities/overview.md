##### Inclusive ActiveSG Facilities

Over the next few years, [ActiveSG](https://www.myactivesg.com/About-ActiveSG) is committed to upgrading facilities and providing training to sport centre staff to make sports facilities more accessible to persons with disabilities and special needs. Please refer [here](https://www.myactivesg.com/Facilities?sport=All&q=&type=accessible-facilities "search here for accessible facilities") for the list of accessible gyms and pools. If you would like to organise a sport centre orientation for a group, please email inclusivesport@sport.gov.sg
