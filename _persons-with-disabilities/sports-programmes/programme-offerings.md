#### Through pilot projects, focus groups, needs sensing, and speaking to stakeholders in the community, we have designed several programmes that serve different needs and gaps in the disability sports industry. 

#### Yes! I Can
Persons with disabilities can start their sporting journey through the Yes! I Can disability sports programme. Yes! I Can is a learn-to-play type programme conducted by certified and experienced coaches so participants can acquire basic sports skills in a fun, safe and conducive environment. Yes! I Can runs for 8-12 sessions depending on the sport, and costs between $100 to $250 per course. Yes! I Can courses are provided when there is sufficient demand. Please email inclusivesport@sport.gov.sg if you are interested in starting a class. 

#### Play-Ability
Jointly established by [Temasek Foundation Cares](https://www.temasekfoundation-cares.org.sg/) and SportCares, Play-Ability provides recreational sports opportunities for PWDs with limited access to sports. PWDs will have access to community sports facilities so they can socialise and stay active on a regular basis.

#### Wow! Experience Sport
Every wondered if youâ€™d ever be able to scuba dive, join an aqua cycling class or rock climb? Wow! Experience Sport gives persons with disabilities a chance to try out a novel activity outside the usual
programme offerings. 

#### Caregiver Workshops
From getting equipped with watersafety skills to learning how to adapt sports to different abilities, caregivers can participate in a series of workshops to enable them and their wards to live better through sport.

#### Intro to Sport
Intro a Sport matches an organisation or a special education school with experienced coaches and persons of expertise in a sport or fitness activity so they can learn how to use sport independently and effectively for physical education, team building, cocurricular activities, bonding and more. Starting with a train-the-trainer learning phase and ending with supervised practical sessions, this initiative is designed to ensure long term sustainability of sporting activities in schools and organisations.
