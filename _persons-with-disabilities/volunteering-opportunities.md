#### Play-Ability Sports Buddy
We are looking for regular sports buddies to serve as befrienders to beneficiaries of the programme! As a Sports Buddy, you will:

* Assist the badminton coach to set up and clean up the field of play
* Assist, interact and and play with the participants
* Assist the coaches with activity demonstration if needed
* Most importantly, put a smile on someone's face!
