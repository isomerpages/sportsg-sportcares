We are looking for regular sports buddies to serve as befrienders to beneficiaries of the programme! As a Sports Buddy, you will:

* Assist the **badminton, basketball, tennis** or **soundball** coaches to set up and clean up the field of play
* Assist, interact and and play with the participants
* Assist the coaches with activity demonstration if needed
* Most importantly, put a smile on someone's face!

Sign up [for volunteering opportunities](https://www.volunteer.gov.sg/) and choose ‘Special Needs/Disabilities’ using the 'Causes' tab followed by ‘Team Nila’ for the 'Agency/Scheme' tab.
