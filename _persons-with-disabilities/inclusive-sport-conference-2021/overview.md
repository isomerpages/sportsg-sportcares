Hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and Sport Singapore (SportSG), and co-hosted by Singapore Disability Sports Council and Special Olympics Singapore, the inaugural Inclusive Sport Conference 2021 (ISC 2021) took place from 16 – 18 March.

Emphasising the importance of embracing inclusivity within the community, President Halimah Yacob who graced the event as Guest-of-Honour said, “Today’s conference serves as a new but important platform to bring all stakeholders in the disability ecosystem together. I am confident that the ideas and discussions put forth at today’s conference can catalyse partnerships among the many stakeholders in Singapore’s disability community, to empower Persons with Disabilities through sport and build a more inclusive society.”

The three-day virtual conference discussed topics ranging from the individual level to community and ecosystem levels, targeting specific focus areas and knowledge gaps surrounding inclusion and adapted sports. The conference aims to strengthen Singapore’s ecosystem for inclusive sports by first establishing a baseline on disability sports and capability building, with a long-term view towards international and regional partnerships.
