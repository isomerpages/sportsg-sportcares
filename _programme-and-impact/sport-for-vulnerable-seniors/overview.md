### Connecting Vulnerable Seniors Through Sport 

SportCares, in partnership with [Active Health](https://www.activehealth.sg) and [Active Masters](https://www.myactivesg.com/Programmes/For-Masters-and-Seniors), continues to proliferate adaptive sport programmes to vulnerable seniors. 

Reaching out to nursing homes, senior care centres and senior activity centres, SportCares spearheads efforts like [developing a toolkit](https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/programme-and-impact/adaptive-sports-toolkit/) and instruction videos for ease of adoption and plug-and-play; as well as facilitating silver sports days and inter-home sport competitions.
