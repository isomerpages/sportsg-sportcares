### Developing Children & Youth:  Leader of Confidence Through Sport

SportCares' methodology uses sport and coach-mentoring to engage young people to build self-esteem, pick-up life skills and enable a strong sense of autonomy through personal development. 

Across our programmes, sport operates as a 'hook' to engage young people, to encourage health and wellbeing, and to achieve positive youth development.   Friendships and relationships built through sport also remove young people from negative influences including anti-social peer groups, dependence & addiction, low self-esteem and boredom.

### Featured **Sport Programmes**

**SATURDAY NIGHT LIGHTS**
> ##### Saturday Night Lights, or SNL, takes underprivileged and youth at-risk off the streets on Saturday nights to give them formal football training and a community of support â€” without charge. Seven years since it started, SNL has grown from a football programme to a development programme, and many SNL youth have gone beyond participating in just football training to regular community volunteering and even leadership courses. 

**SWIMMING PROGRAMME**
>##### Since its inception in 2016, the SportCares Swimming Programme has been making waves across Singapore by equipping youth at-risk with water confidence skills. Aside from helping them improve their basic swimming proficiency, the programme positively impacts their lives by providing them with a safe space to express themselves and develop leadership skills while being part of a sporting family.  Under the mentorship of Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) approved swimming coaches, youth undergo a series of weekly training sessions that help to hone both their mental and physical abilities.
