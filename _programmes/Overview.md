At SportCares, we use sport to change lives.  

Our guiding model for all we do in the community is called the SportCares Hearts Framework. This framework is based on our experiences and global best practices in community sport and social development. 

The Hearts framework comprises five components:   
(1) Build a sticky pad  
(2) Build relationships  
(3) Develop skills, shape character  
(4) Lead self  
(5) Lead team, lead community

Using this framework and support from various community partners and donors, we create a community of care for all, including children and youth from vulnerable backgrounds, isolated seniors, and persons with disabilities (PwDs).
