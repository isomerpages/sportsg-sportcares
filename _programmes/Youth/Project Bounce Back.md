SportCares works with institutions such as Singapore Prisons Services, Singapore Boys Home, Singapore Girls Home, and Singapore Boysâ€™ Hostel to support the in-care, rehabilitation and reintegration journey for young offenders & youth in need through sport.

Throughcare collaboration starts in these institutions and continues into the community to provide the participants an opportunity to develop and maintain a pro-social network. 
 
About 100 young offenders and youth in need currently have weekly access to sport.

If you are keen to have this programme in your facility or want to learn more about it, reach out to us&nbsp;[here](mailto:sportcares@sport.gov.sg), with your details and we will contact you within seven (7) working days with more information.
