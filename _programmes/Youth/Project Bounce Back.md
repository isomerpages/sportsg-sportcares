SportCares works with institutions such as Singapore Prisons Services, Singapore Boys Home, Singapore Girls Home, and Singapore Boys’ Hostel to support the in-care, rehabilitation and reintegration journey for young offenders & youth in need through sport.

Throughcare collaboration starts in these institutions and continues into the community to provide the participants an opportunity to develop and maintain a pro-social network. 
 
About 100 young offenders and youth in need currently have weekly access to sport.
