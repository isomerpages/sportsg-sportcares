The SportCares Champions Leadership Programme (SCLP) is an initiative that allows our participants to adopt a leadership track while being part of SportCares through its community programmes. 

Participants in SCLP go on to manage various engagements in society, taking roles such as planning, budgeting, facilitating and more as they give back through initiatives and social causes they hold close to their hearts.

If you want to learn more about it, reach out to us&nbsp;[here](mailto:sportcares@sport.gov.sg), with your details and we will contact you within seven (7) working days with more information.
