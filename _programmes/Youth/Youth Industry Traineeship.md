Youth Industry Traineeship (YIT) aims to help bridge the gap and equip our participants with the skills and confidence they need to succeed in their soon-to-be careers.

Open to youth between 17 to 23 years old, the YIT is designed to allow them to join companies and learn valuable life and employable skills. 

Participants will also be matched with a mentor through the SportCares Mentorship Programme, who will help guide them through every step of the process. They will then be placed in an industry setting that allows them to engage with an employer and access relevant career guidance and support.


If you are keen to have this programme in your community or want to learn more about it, reach out to us&nbsp;[here](mailto:sportcares@sport.gov.sg), with your details and we will contact you within seven (7) working days with more information.
