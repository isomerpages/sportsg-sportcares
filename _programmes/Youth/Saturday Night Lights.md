<p>Our football programme, Saturday Night Lights (SNL) is a sport-based development
programme for youth aged 13 to 21.</p>
<p>SNL creates the platform for our participants to build values through
sport and opportunities to pick up relevant life skills through non-sport
initiatives and courses. With various training venues spread across the
island, eligible participants will be matched to the nearest training location
using their residential address.</p>
