Let’s SEPAK is a collaboration between SportCares and PERSES (the national sporting association for Sepak Takraw) aimed at using Sepak Takraw to positively nurture and care for its participants.

The programme is currently available at Heartbeat@Bedok, Crest Secondary School and Northland Secondary School.

It is open to youth aged 13 – 21 and eligible participants will be matched to the nearest available training location using their residential address.
