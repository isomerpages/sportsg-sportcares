<p>FUN Starters is a multi-sport programme that seeks to engage, support
and uplift children, aged 5 to 12, from vulnerable communities through
curated sport, physical, health and wellness programmes.</p>
<p>The programme is a joint initiative of SportCares and Temasek Foundation.
For more information on this partnership, head over <a href="https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/media/stories/launchoffunstarters/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
<p>The programme is offered free of charge, and all equipment and materials
will be provided, with weekly sessions conducted in community spaces close
to the participantsâ€™ residential location.</p>

<p>SportCares also works closely with community leaders, MSF Social Services
Offices (SSOs), and other organisations to ensure that the participants
receive the support they need to succeed both on and off the field. In
addition, SportCares will engage the parents of our participants on building
healthy habits through relevant workshops and campaigns.</p>
<p>FUN Starters is currently present in different parts of Singapore, with
each programme venue hosting up to two dedicated community partners.</p>
