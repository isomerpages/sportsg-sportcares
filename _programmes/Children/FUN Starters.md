FUN Starters is a multi-sport programme that seeks to engage, support and uplift children, aged 5 to 12, from vulnerable communities through curated sport, physical, health and wellness programmes. 

The programme is a joint initiative of SportCares and Temasek Foundation. For more information on this partnership, head over [here](https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/media/stories/launchoffunstarters/)!

The programme is offered free of charge, and all equipment and materials will be provided, with weekly sessions conducted in community spaces close to the participantsâ€™ residential location.

SportCares also works closely with community leaders, MSF Social Services Offices (SSOs), and other organisations to ensure that the children receive the support they need to succeed both on and off the field. 

In addition, SportCares will engage the parents of our partcipants on building healthy habits through relevant workshops and national campaigns.
