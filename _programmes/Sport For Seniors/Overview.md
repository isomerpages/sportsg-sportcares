### Connecting Seniors Through Sport 

SportCares, in partnership with [Active Health](https://www.activehealth.sg) and [Active Masters](https://www.myactivesg.com/Programmes/For-Masters-and-Seniors), continues to proliferate adaptive sport programmes to vulnerable seniors. 

Working alongside nursing homes, senior care centres and senior activity centres, SportCares uses its resources on efforts like developing a toolkit and creating simple instructional videos, as well as facilitating silver sports days and inter-home sport competitions.
