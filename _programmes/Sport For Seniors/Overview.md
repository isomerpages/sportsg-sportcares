### Connecting Seniors Through Sport 

SportCares, in partnership with Active Health and [Active Masters](https://www.myactivesg.com/Programmes/For-Masters-and-Seniors), continues to provide adaptive sport programmes to vulnerable seniors. 

Working alongside nursing homes, senior care centres and senior activity centres, we use our resources on efforts like developing a toolkit and creating simple instructional videos, as well as facilitating silver sports days and inter-home sport competitions.

We also manage a community programme, Morning Exercises with SportCares, designed to engage isolated seniors through weekly morning exercise routines at a community space close to their homes.

Our programme creates a safe and welcoming environment for seniors to socialise and participate in light exercise routines every week. All sessions are led by certified trainers and tailored to meet the physical needs of our participants.

Currently, through our partner, Kreta Ayer Seniors Activity Centre, we have established the programme at their branches located at Jalan Kukoh, Chin Swee Road and Banda Street, engaging up to 140 seniors per session across the above mentioned centres.
