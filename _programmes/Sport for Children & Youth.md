SportCares uses sport and coach-mentoring to engage young people to build self-esteem, pick-up life skills and enable a strong sense of autonomy through personal development. 

Across our programmes, sport operates as a platform to engage young people, to encourage health and wellbeing, and to achieve positive youth development.
