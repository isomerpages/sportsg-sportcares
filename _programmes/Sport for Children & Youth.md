### Developing Children & Youth:  Leader of Confidence Through Sport

SportCares' methodology uses sport and coach-mentoring to engage young people to build self-esteem, pick-up life skills and enable a strong sense of autonomy through personal development. 

Across our programmes, sport operates as a 'hook' to engage young people, to encourage health and wellbeing, and to achieve positive youth development.   Friendships and relationships built through sport also remove young people from negative influences including anti-social peer groups, dependence & addiction, low self-esteem and boredom.
