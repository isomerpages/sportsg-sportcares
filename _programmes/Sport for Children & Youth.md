SportCares uses sport and coach-mentoring to work with children and youth to build self-esteem, learn life skills and enable a strong sense of independence through personal development. 

Across our programmes, sport is the platform we use to engage participants, encourage health and wellbeing, and achieve positive development. Friendships and relationships built through sport also remove them from negative influences, including anti-social peer groups, dependence & addiction, low self-esteem and boredom. 

And mentioned below are the community programmes that we currently manage with the support of various community partners and donors. 

##### SportCares Programmes for Children:
* Community Futsal Programme
* Community Basketball Programme
* Community Swimming Programme 
* CareRunners (Athletics)
* Project Kind (Multi-Sport) 

##### SportCares Programmes for Youth:
* Saturday Night Lights (Football)
* Let's Sepak (Sepak Takraw) 
* Multi-Sport Programme (Running, Swimming, Cycling) 
* SportCares Champions (Leadership Programme) 

#### Featured SportCares Programme
###### SATURDAY NIGHT LIGHTS
> ##### Saturday Night Lights, or SNL, is a football-based development programme that gives vulnerable youths aged 13 to 21 the chance to build values through the sport and opportunities to pick up relevant life skills through non-sport initiatives and courses.


We also work with government agencies such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to bring our sport-based development programmes to the rehabilitation institutions under their purview. 
This is in line with our intention to use sport to support the Singapore Prison Services' (SPS) [Throughcare Approach](https://www.sps.gov.sg/throughcare-approach) in the rehabilitation of offenders.
