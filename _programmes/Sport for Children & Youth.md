SportCares uses sport and coach-mentoring to work with children and youth to build self-esteem, learn life skills and enable a strong sense of independence through personal development. Friendships and relationships made through sport also remove them from negative influences they may experience in their routine environment.

We constantly work towards creating safe spaces for our participants and mentioned below are the community programmes we manage, with the support of various community partners and donors.

* Community Basketball Programme

#### Featured SportCares Programme

Saturday Night Lights (SNL), is a football-based development programme that gives vulnerable youths aged 13 to 21 the chance to build values through the sport and opportunities to pick up relevant life skills through non-sport initiatives and courses.
