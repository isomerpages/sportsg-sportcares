<p>Jointly developed by the trainers from the Agency for Integrated Care
(AIC) and SportCares, the "Fit &amp; Fun" Adaptive Sports Toolkit is targeted
at community care partners, as a resource pack to help them keep seniors
fit and happy. The toolkit includes modified games that are suitable for
seniors of all abilities, including seniors on wheelchairs, stroke-recovery
patients and seniors with early/intermediate stages of dementia. The toolkit
aims to improve the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of our seniors
as they stay fit, active and socially connected when playing the sport
activities.</p>
<p>The free toolkit provides facilitation tips and step-by-step instructions
on setting up and executing the games for the seniors, with additional
assistance offered through instructional videos. These resources are provided
for Community Care staff and volunteers to organise and facilitate the
sports sessions confidently.</p>
