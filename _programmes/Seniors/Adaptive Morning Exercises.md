Our Adaptive Morning Exercises are designed to engage seniors on a weekly basis at a community space close to their homes, with every session led by certified trainers and tailored to meet the physical needs of our participants.

Currently, through our partner, Kreta Ayer Seniors Activity Centre, we have established the programme at their branches located at Jalan Kukoh, Chin Swee Road and Banda Street, engaging up to 140 seniors per session.
