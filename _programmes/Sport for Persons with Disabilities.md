## Building an Inclusive Society Through Sport

Since 2017, SportCares led inclusion efforts in the community by promoting play and sport opportunities for persons with disabilities and special needs, including empowering those who can, to give back to the community. 

Programmes such as Play-Ability and Yes! I Can offer participants with sport opportunities that cater to the different levels and types of disabilities and needs. These programmes also creates experiences that enable participants to grow and become more confident as they get connected to a supportive and empowered community.
