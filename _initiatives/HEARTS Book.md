The HEARTS book was launched by SportCares patron President Halimah Yacob at the SportCares 10-Year Anniversary Dinner at Our Tampines Hub on 19 November 2022.

The key reflections and learnings from delivering programmes to the communities we serve have been encapsulated in the SportCares HEARTS book, providing a resource guide for organisations, corporations and schools that wish to leverage sport for social good.

The HEARTS acronym represents what SportCares has achieved over the years: Holistic development, the Empowerment of the community to be the change they want to see, the Amplification of their strength through partnerships, Responsiveness to the needs of the community, Thoughtfulness when it comes to attaining desired outcomes, and Stories to inspire others.
