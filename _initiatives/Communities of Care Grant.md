### SportCares Communities of Care Grants

The SportCares Communities of Care (COC) grants support the development of sports programmes that promote social good. The grants aim to empower individuals and organisations who are focused on using sport as a tool for community development. 

The objectives of the COC grants are to:
* Support long-term, regular programmes that empower the vulnerable and underserved groups through sport;
* Foster equal access to sports opportunities for the vulnerable and underserved groups;
* Promote innovative and collaborative efforts that uses sport to build communities and achieve social inclusion; and
* Establish sustainable strategic partnerships with organisations that promote prosocial initiatives.

### Types of COC Grants

SportCares offers two types of COC grants:

__Starter Grant__  
Provides seed funding of up to $50,000 to support individuals and/or groups who wish to organise a smaller scale sport-based development programme in the community. The grant is for one year. 

__Development Grant__ 
Provides multi-year funding to intermediary organisations to invest in holistic sport-based programmes for the vulnerable and underserved, while using the programme to build and strengthen community. This grant will be based on a three-year funding timeline. Grant funding will be up to $200,000 in the first year, with the funding quantum decreasing with each subsequent year.

### Our Key Focus Areas for COC Grants
