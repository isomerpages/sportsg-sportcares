### Join us in Changing Lives Through Sport!

**Donate  – Your invaluable contribution helps to enable and empower vulnerable individuals and communities through sport.** 
<br> To make a donation, head over to our campaign page on [giving.sg ](https://www.giving.sg/vision2030/sportcares2023). <br>


**Partner – Collaborate with us to make sport possible and accessible for everyone.** 
<br> We are always looking to work with the wider community to bring sport closer to suitable venues located in the neighbourhood. If you have an programme idea or have a community group in mind that can benefit through a partnership, connect with us and we will get the conversation going. 
<br> For more on our current line-up of programmes, see [here](https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/programmes/children-and-youth/). <br> 


**Share – Let everyone know about our events and programmes.** 
<br> Know of a community group that is doing great work in the community, inspiring volunteers who make the all-important difference in the lives of vulnerable individuals, a new non-profit that is trying to navigate the social good space? Let them know about us by sharing our website, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SportCaresSG) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sportcares/) pages with them. 
<br> You can also get more information on how to get started on your own sport-based community programme using our [HEARTS Book ](https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/initiatives/heartsbook/). <br> 


Or simply reach out to us [here](mailto:sportcares@sport.gov.sg), with details of your name, contact number, company name (if applicable) and a short description of your programme idea, potential collaboration initiative or a community group that is keen to use sport as part of their engagement plan. And we will in touch with you within seven (7) working days with more information.
