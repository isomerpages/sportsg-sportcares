Since the launch of the Community Link (ComLink) by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), SportCares has been strengthening its efforts to engage more citizens in each ComLink town through its partnership with MSF's network of Social Service Offices and community partners.

Sport is an appealing tool that can be used by the community when planning outreach and engagement initiatives, as it provides various opportunities for children and families to participate in fun activities, build social connections, develop new skills and adopt suitable health and wellness routines.

Here are some programmes and initiatives that you can share with the families you are engaging on your befriending sessions: 
##### Saturday Night Lights (SNL) 

* SNL, one of our flagship programmes, is a football-based development programme that gives vulnerable youth aged 13 to 21 the chance to build values through the sport, opportunities to pick up relevant life skills through non-sport initiatives and courses.
* It is currently offered island-wide at nine stadiums across Singapore, serving close to 450 youth.
* Eligibility: Youth aged 13 – 21. And eligible participants will be matched to the nearest available training location using their residential address.
