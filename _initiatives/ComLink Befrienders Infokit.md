Since the launch of the Community Link (ComLink) by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), SportCares has been strengthening its efforts to engage more citizens in each ComLink town through its partnership with MSF's network of Social Service Offices and community partners.

Sport is an appealing tool that can used by the community when planning outreach and engagement initiatives as it provides various opportunities for children and families to participate in fun activities, build social connections, and develop new skills.

Here are some programmes and initiatives that you can share with the families you are engaging on your befriending sessions:

&gt; Saturday Night Lights (SNL)

* SNL, one of our flagship programmes, is a football-based development programme that gives vulnerable youth aged 13 to 21 the chance to build values through the sport, opportunities to pick up relevant life skills through non-sport initiatives and courses.
* It is currently offered island-wide at nine stadiums across Singapore, serving close to 450 youth.
* Eligibility: Youth aged 13 – 21. And eligible participants will be matched to the nearest available training location using their residential address.

&gt; FunStarters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

* FUN Starters is a multi-sport programme that seeks to engage, support and uplift children from vulnerable communities through curated sport, physical, health and wellness programmes. &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Eligibility: Children aged 5 to 12.

&gt; Let’s SEPAK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

* Let’s SEPAK is a collaboration between SportCares and PERSES (the national sporting association for Sepak Takraw) aimed at using Sepak Takraw to positively nurture and care for its participants.
* The programme is currently available at four locations across the island, Heartbeat@Bedok, Crest Secondary School, NorthLand Secondary School, and Pertapis Centre for Women and Girls. &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Eligibility: Youth aged 13 – 21. Participants will be matched to the nearest available training location using their residential address.

&gt; SportCares Bursary Scheme&nbsp;&nbsp;

* The SportCares Bursary is offered to children &amp; youth on public financial assistance schemes to participate in various ActiveSG Academies and Clubs programmes. &nbsp;

By joining a SportCares programme, the participants will have access to other SportCares initiatives such as:

&gt; SportCares Mentorship Programme

We pair participants with verified mentors to help them successfully navigate the challenging transitions and demands that are routinely encountered during development.

&gt; Youth Industry Traineeship

The Youth Industry Traineeship aims to provide our youth with valuable opportunities to develop employability skills and understand the work industry and employer expectations.
&gt; Youth Coaching Development Programme

The Youth Coaching Development Programme is a structured training and skills development programme for our youth who aspire to take up sport coaching as a career in future. The programme provides a training pathway for the youths to obtain full membership in the National Registry of Coaches (NROC). <br> Through the learnings, exposure and experience obtained in this programme, they will also serve as role models and inspire other participants to pursue the passion.  They will be required to give back through volunteer coaching assignments within the programme offered by SportCares in the community.
