The SportCares HEARTS book was launched by our patron President Halimah Yacob at the SportCares 10-Year Anniversary Dinner at Our Tampines Hub on 19 November 2022.

The key reflections and learnings from delivering programmes to the communities we serve have been encapsulated in the SportCares HEARTS book, providing a resource guide for organisations, corporations and schools that wish to leverage sport for social good.
